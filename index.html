              As your Social Media partner in creation, playing on words is what truly excites me. Having said that, I’m reminded of the pocket Dictionary and Thesaurus I carried around constantly in High School, so yes I can be defined as a word nerd at heart.

                The marketing industry really lights me up, because just as I’ve learned from Whoopi Goldberg during her one episode appearance on ‘A Different World,’ I am a voice in this world and I deserve to be heard. I aspire for my content to be seen across various media channels and used as the framework for PSAs, music video concepts, commercials, sponsored ads, and a host of brand campaigns.
